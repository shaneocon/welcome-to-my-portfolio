## Description
 
- Functional, deployed application
- GitHub repository with README describing the project
- Navbar must be consistent on each page.
- Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About Contact, and Portfolio pages.
- All links must work.
- Must use semantic html.
- Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
- Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
- Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.


## Solution
    I began by pulling the starter code from Bootstrap and it was off to the races.  Me being the tortoise, of course.  
    
    Coding with Bootstrap was challenging for me because I couldn't quite seem to grasp the grid styling but I do feel more comfortable now than I did before starting this assignment.   

## Usage 

This website can be used to attract potential clients as well as job recruiters.  It will detail professional projects while also granting a window into a bit of my personal bio.

# Summary

It's not a pretty website, but it will get the job done for my first attempt at a multi-pager from scratch.  

I really enjoyed this assignment because it pushed me to use Google more than I had previously thought possible. And what do you know? I was able to find 90% of the answers and implement them into my application.  

However, I still have lingering questions regarding the Bootstrap Grid system and will have to address those with the instructor soon.  But I feel like I'm starting to grasp more and more each day and that is a good feeling for someone who, when it comes to web development, is the definition of "green behind the ears."
